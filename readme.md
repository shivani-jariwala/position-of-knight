## Problem Statement

Write a program that takes the position of a Knight as an input on an 8x8
chessboard.
Given the position of the Knight, find all the possible places where the Knight can
move. You can assume that there are no pieces of the opposite color and hence no
blocks.

## Theory

Assuming their is no blocker on the chessboard, taking the position of the Knight as an input from the user the possible moves are found.
The Knight can only move 
1. Two moves horizontal and one move vertical 
2. Two moves vertical and one move horizontal

To run the program follow the steps
1. Clone the repo
2. npm install
3. node app.js
